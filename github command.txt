Step 1 – Make sure you’re inside your project

Run:

cd "C:\Users\khanquah\OneDrive - Keysight Technologies\software\Test Automation Project\dashboard_app\MARS_Dashboard"


Then check:

dir


You should see your .py, .sln, or other project files listed.

🧩 Step 2 – Initialize Git if needed

If you haven’t done this in this folder yet:

git init

🧩 Step 3 – Add and commit your files

This actually creates the first snapshot and the main branch.

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"


If you see “nothing added to commit”, that means all files are already staged — that’s fine.

🧩 Step 4 – Rename the branch to main
git branch -M main

🧩 Step 5 – Push to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/butterwingky/MARS_Dashboard.git
git push -u origin main


If it says the remote already exists:

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/butterwingky/API_Trial.git
git push -u origin main





🚀 Best Practices to Avoid Conflicts

Always pull before pushing

git pull origin main


Then

git push origin main




Push code:
Step	Command			Purpose
1	git status		See what changed
2	git add .		Stage changes
3	git commit -m 		"Message"	Save snapshot
4	git pull origin main	Get latest updates
5	git push origin main	Upload your changes
